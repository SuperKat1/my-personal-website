  <h2>From My Garden</h2>
  <p>A year ago, I decided to transform a little patch of unloved earth outsidfe my back door, from a weed infested eye sore, into a happy little garden bed for everyone to enjoy.
      It took me about 3 weeks to pull out the weeds, dig up and condition the soil and pop down some pine bark to help keep the weeds away, and the moisture for the plants in.
      I love Australian native plants, plus they tend to survive my slightly erratic care, so got myself some small pots, and planted away.
      One year later, I have a gorgeous garden which has something flowering at through the year, which I think is especially nice in winter.
      Here's a few in flower now, plus a lovely photo of the blossoms of the plum tree that I can look forward to in Spring.
